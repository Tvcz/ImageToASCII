# ImageToASCII
An image to text converter that focuses on the accurate translation of edges and uses whitespace liberally. Proper viewing of text requires a sufficiently wide text editor with a monospaced font. Written in Python.

Feel free to submit pull requests with new features/QOL improvements. Currently I'd like to improve how it handles inputs and add options for processing gifs and videos.
