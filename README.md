# ImageToASCII
An image to text converter that focuses on the accurate translation of edges and uses whitespace liberally. Proper viewing of text requires a sufficiently wide text editor with a monospaced font. Written in Python.

Currently WIP. Feel free to submit pull requests with new features/QOL improvements.
