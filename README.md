# ImageToASCII
An image to text converter that focuses on the accurate translation of edges and uses whitespace liberally. Proper viewing of text requires a sufficiently wide text editor with a monospaced font. Written in Python.

Feel free to submit pull requests with new features/QOL improvements. Currently I'd like to improve how it handles inputs and add options for processing gifs and videos.



###Examples:

Input:
![Star Destroyer](https://github.com/Tvcz/ImageToASCII/blob/main/Samples/star_destroyer.jpg?raw=true)

Output:
![Star Destroyer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tvcz/ImageToASCII/main/Samples/star_destroyer.txt)
